    <p style="width: 80%;">Hi there, nice to meet you, and welcome to my personal website! My name 
        is Sophie Liu, and I am so glad you stopped by! I think you're here 
        to get to know me (who knows maybe I'll get to meet you someday :D), 
        so I'll get right into it.  
        
        As of right now, I study Computational Biology and Machine Learning at the School of Computer
        Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently set to graduate in 2024.</p>

      <h2>A Little About My Professional Interests</h2>
      <div class="intro-container">
        <p> 
            After I graduate, I hope to contribute fundamental improvements to the world of computational biology.
            For instance, coming up with a new way to seauence proteins using nanopores, redefining how we analyze 
            protein dynamics or structure, discovering new underlying rules behind cell biology, or something like that.
        </p>
        <p>

            I love all things biology!As much as I enjoy a good qt-PCR session with the team, I can always appreciate a good coding challenge in Python, SML, Java, or C.At CMU, I can live the best of both worlds by solving biological problems using computational methods.

      <h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Since high school, I found gratification in seeing my peers find joy in learning. Before college,
        I tutored students in subjects from biology, chemistry, algebra, calculus, english, and even debate!
      </p>
      <p>
        I will be having my first experience in August 2023 as a teacher's assistant in college for the course
        15-451/651 Algorithm Design and Analysis. We will be covering topics like amortized analysis for potential functions,
        linear programming, dynamic programming, min-cut max-flow, hashing, segtrees, streaming algorithms, and computaitonal geometry!
