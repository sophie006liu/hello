          My name is Sophie Liu, and I am so glad you stopped by! I think you're here 
          to get to know me better (maybe I'll get to meet you someday too :)),

          Currently, I study Computational Biology and Machine Learning at the School of Computer
          Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I am set to graduate in Spring 2024.

        <h2 >A Little About My Professional Interests</h2>
        <p>  
          After I graduate, I will contribute fundamental improvements to the world of computational biology by creating 
          the tools that other scientists use to advance their research. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Some tasks that speak to my interests include: developing novel algorithms for high-throughput protein sequencing, 
          redefining how we simulate/predict protein dynamics and structure, discovering new underlying rules behind cell signal transduction through simulation, 
          and developing more accessible and intuitive <em>de novo</em> protein design pipelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is <em> so much </em> for me to learn about the field of computational biology, so I really enjoy problems that push me to think harder
          and teach me something new.

            <h3>Amgen 2023</h3>
            <p>Topics: AWS Cloud computing, Full Stack, IgFold, Protein Folding, Generative AI</p>
            <div class="hidden-content expanded-card-content">
              I am currently an intern at Amgen working on four projects. 
              <ul>
                <li>The first project involves creating an Amazon Machine Image for the Molecular modeling team.
                  By constructing the packer and ansible playbook I am learning a lot about
                  <span class="orange-text">AWS and cloud infrastructure and software configuration</span> 
                  as I try to add all the necessary add-ons to the AMI.        
                </li>
                <li>The second project involves more full stack responsibilties to make an internal 
                  webapp that allows users to submit arxiv papers, ask questions about the paper,
                   and recieve technically detailed and accurate answers. Doing this I have become 
                   proficient with <span class="orange-text">LangChain</span>, a framework for development
                   using language models,<span class="orange-text"> OpenAI api, React, Node.js, Flask,</span> and 
                   <span class="orange-text"> website deployment on AWS. </span>
                </li>
                <li>The third task pertains to <span class="orange-text">setting up a pipeline that allows scientists to predict the structure of 
                  antibodies</span>. My task was to take state of the start antibody folding scripts and write the necessary shell, 
                  python, and dockerfiles to create a scalable pipeline for folding single or multiple antibodies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  My final project involves creating a standard test that the company can use to benchmark the performance
                  of protein folding tools existing or new. With this procedure, the company can carefully evaluate newly released  
                  protein folding resources to see if they are worth incorporating. <span class="orange-text">This task effectively sets the stage for all downstream molecular
                  simulations done on potential drug targets.</span>

              <h3>Peptilogics 2022</h3> 
              <p>Topics:Peptide Folding, PyRosetta, Rosetta, Ab Initio Folding</p>
              <div class="hidden-content expanded-card-content">
                During the summer going into my junior year, I had the privilege of working at Peptilogics, a 
                company focused on peptide-based theraputics.
                <ul>
                  <li>The first project was to take in custom information encoded on a PDB file, and display it in the
                    log of a molecular visualization program called ChimeraX. The code was written in python using the 
                    chimerax.core.commands library, and enabled simulation scientists to have a cleaner view of their desired
                    data from an ensemble PDB. 
                  </li>
                  <li>The second project also involved adding commands to ChimeraX. My task was to create a command that allows
                    scientists to color PDB residues based on custom attributes besides b-factors like Rosetta Energy Score. </span>
                  </li>
                  <li>The third task was to create a peptide folding pipeline for the company using the <em>ab initio</em> script on 
                    Rosetta. I learned how to use the pyRosetta python library, Rosetta suite, python, and bash scripting to make 
                    pipelines to fold peptides in batch. To measure our performance, we used the RMSD and pandas, numpy toolkits to
                    compare against industry standards Alphafold and PEPFOLD. My custom parameters and procedure was able to outperform
                    both programs in the use case of peptides, and now is now being used by the company in their drug discovery pipeline.

                Since March 2021 of my freshman year, I have had the privilege of studying
                protein dynamics with my mentor Dr. Pemra Doruker and Dr. Burak Kaynak under Dr. Ivet Bahar.
                <ul>
                  <li> My project focuses using our in-house ESSA library to predict top binding sites for GPCRs
                    by measuring the impact of ligand binding on protein dynamics for each potential site.
                  </li>
                  <li> At the Bahar Lab, I have been able ot use a lot of ESSA, python, pandas, and numpy to 
                    handle large amounts of data efficiently. In addition, I use bash scripting to 
                    automate simulations and experimentation to circumvent manual data annotion. </span>

        <p>
          Since high school, I found gratification in seeing my peers find joy in learning. Before college,
          I tutored students in subjects from biology, chemistry, algebra, calculus, english, and even debate!
        </p>
        <p>
          I will be having my first experience in August 2023 as a teacher's assistant in college for the course
          15-451/651 Algorithm Design and Analysis. We will be covering topics like amortized analysis for potential functions,
          linear programming, dynamic programming, min-cut max-flow, hashing, segtrees, streaming algorithms, and computaitonal geometry!
